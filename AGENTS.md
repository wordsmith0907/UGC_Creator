- Keep the RingView carousel as the full-viewport index experience, with its ring geometry and motion in the route and global stylesheet; this preserves the reference's precise projection and drag behavior.
- Store source carousel media as Lovable asset pointers under src/assets/ringview; this avoids bundling downloaded binary files and keeps the original media available.
